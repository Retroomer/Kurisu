Replacement shells for most systems can be found on AliExpress (cheap, slow shipping) and Amazon (more expensive, faster shipping). It is noteworthy that most, if not all, third-party shells are of subpar quality compared to OEM shells. Therefore, it is recommended not to replace your OEM shell unless it is absolutely necessary.

For DS, 2DS and 3DS handhelds, most 3rd party shell replacements are of the same quality. There is little difference between brands regarding plastic quality and quality control. There is usually a higher risk of cracking being reported on transparent shells, as transparent plastics usually use a mix of plastics that ends up being more fragile than non-transparent colors.

For the Switch (OLED), eXtremeRate is the recommended brand for replacement shells. There are also unbranded aluminium shell parts available for various Switch systems, of which the quality seems decent as well.

For the GB, GBC, GBA, and GBA SP, replacement parts (including shells) from [FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com) are recommended.
