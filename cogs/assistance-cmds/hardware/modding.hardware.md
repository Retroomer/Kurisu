Do you want to mod or repair your system by yourself? It might be wise to first ask yourself if: 
* You're proficient and familiar enough with electronic repairs in order to not damage your own system,
* You have the right tools available to you (see https://discord.com/channels/196618637950451712/233002779717795850/1146584298191851582 for a list of tools),
* You have enough experience soldering (if applicable),
* You have enough experience using powertools (if applicable).
