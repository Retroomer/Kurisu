Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) is the recommended cleaning agent to clean electronics with. It's safe to use on circuit boards when the percentage of IPA is above 90%, ideally ~99%. 

\>90% IPA is NOT the same as ethanol (ethyl alcoho) or rubbing alcohol. Regular ethanol can contain water and minerals, and rubbing alcohol can be a concoction of multiple chemicals.

IPA is safe to use with the majority of plastics. However, it is noteworthy that IPA can potentially damage/dissolve LCD's, specific plastic coatings, paint, and glue.
